# passinneed
**Introduction**

Purpose of our project is to create a **Password Generator**, a program that **generates a random password** to **fulfill the requirements of the password** (e.g password requires at least 8 alphanumeric and at least 1 capital letter, etc.). We will be using **Python with OOP** for this project. 

We will be using this document to **add/update ideas** and **how we should execute the plan** to create the program. Simply put, itâ€™s a process journal for our project ðŸ˜€

**Vision**

This project is intended to solely **focus on the password generator function and UI**. In future, more features may be added.

Hope this project would help us to understand better for programming in Python and get used to using OOP

P.S We're noobs
